# Wedding Organization System

## Overview
A C++ automation system designed to manage wedding events, guest lists, and financial details. The project creates a relational data environment using flat text files to ensure data persistence and organization.

## Technical Implementation
* **Architecture:** Modular C++ design separating interface (`.h`) from implementation (`.cpp`).
* **Data Persistence:** Custom file handling using `std::fstream`. Data is stored in **pipe-delimited (`|`)** text files in the `data/` directory.
* **Memory Management:** Implements **vector-less file manipulation**. Large datasets are not loaded into memory; instead, operations (like search, delete, update) are performed via stream processing and temporary file swapping (`temp.txt`).
* **Relational Logic:** Uses `DugunNo` as a **Foreign Key** to link records across `Dugunler.txt`, `Davetliler.txt`, and `OrganizasyonDetay.txt`.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Cascade Delete:** Deleting a wedding automatically triggers the deletion of linked guests and cost records.
    * **Multi-pass Reporting:** Seating plans are generated by scanning file streams multiple times to filter Bride/Groom sides without in-memory sorting.

## Features
* **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, Delete for Weddings, Guests, and Costs.
* **Cost Analysis:** Calculates total expenses (Food, Accessories, Artists, etc.).
* **Seating Plans:** Generates lists separated by relationship (Bride's Side vs. Groom's Side).
* **Validation:** Prevents duplicate cost records and ensures data integrity.

## Build & Run
**Using Make:**
```powershell
make clean
make
make run

```

**Manual Compile:**

```powershell
g++ -std=c++17 -Iinclude src/*.cpp -o bin/WeddingApp.exe

```
